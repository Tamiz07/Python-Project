## 1.Number Guessing:
Link : https://github.com/Tamiz07/Python-Project/blob/main/number_guess.py
<p>I have developed a Python beginner project which includes two functions. The first function allows the user to guess the number that the computer has generated, while the second function enables the computer to guess the number chosen by the user. Throughout this project, I have gained experience with Python explicit functions, if-else statements, and while loops.</p>
